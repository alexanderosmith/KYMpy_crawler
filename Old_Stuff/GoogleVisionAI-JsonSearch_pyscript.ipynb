That infomration is often in text format, but the text on the TV and the text of \"And that's a fact\" are in very different locations within the image in most cases. The meaning here might be to say \"And that's a fact\" is the character, PewDiePie, responding to an agentially distinguishable utterance. If this is important to the meme structure, then perhaps the only way to determine this is by spacial distance of text. If it is not, then we can bypass this concern."
